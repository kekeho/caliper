    # Specifies the available SDK bindings and their Node.js-specific install settings
    # IMPORTANT:
    # The Integration tests cache all the SUT bindings EXCEPT for the fabric:2.4 binding. Therefore
    # for those bindings if you want to update a binding with new version dependencies you need to
    # create a new version and update the integration tests explicitly to reference this new version.
    # For example if the current version of the fabric 2.2 binding is 2.2.14 and you want to update
    # the binding to include a new level of dependencies, you must create a 2.2.15 binding and update
    # the integration tests to reference this.
    # The exception is fabric:2.4 which isn't cached in the integration tests. This means you can modify
    # the 2.4 key without creating a new version and the integration tests will automatically pick it up.
